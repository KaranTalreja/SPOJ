Alice and Bob need to send secret messages to each other and are discussing ways to encode their messages:

Alice: “Let’s just use a very simple code: We’ll assign ‘A’ the code word 1, ‘B’ will be 2, and so on down to ‘Z’ being assigned 26.”

Bob: “That’s a stupid code, Alice. Suppose I send you the word ‘BEAN’ encoded as 25114. You could decode that in many different ways!”
Alice: “Sure you could, but what words would you get? Other than ‘BEAN’, you’d get ‘BEAAD’, ‘YAAD’, ‘YAN’, ‘YKD’ and ‘BEKD’. I think you would be able to figure out the correct decoding. And why would you send me the word ‘BEAN’ anyway?”
Bob: “OK, maybe that’s a bad example, but I bet you that if you got a string of length 5000 there would be tons of different decodings and with that many you would find at least two different ones that would make sense.”
Alice: “How many different decodings?”
Bob: “Jillions!”

For some reason, Alice is still unconvinced by Bob’s argument, so she requires a program that will determine how many decodings there can be for a given string using her code.

Instructions:
1.To build run command
    make
2.To run testcases run command in current directory
    ./runCases.sh

3.Maintain Testcases

List of all the failed testcases is entered into TestResult/failedCases.
Analyze the failiures by looking at TEST files in the respective directory. Regold the testcases by running the following command.

./reGold.sh TestResult/failedCases
