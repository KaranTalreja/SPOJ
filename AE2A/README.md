Jack claims that he has telekinetic powers. He has made a bet with Mike that he would throw a die n times and would get exactly k pips in total. Jack's die has 6 faces with numbers from 1 to 6 written on them and is perfectly symmetric. Mike does not believe in Jack's telekinetic powers (in general, being a tenacious rationalist, he does not believe in telekinesis), but he is concerned that Jack could win the bet simply by luck. Therefore, he would like to know what is the chance (in percent) of such an unlucky event, and asked you to write a program that would help him solve this problem.

Instructions:
1.To build run command
    make
2.To run testcases run command in current directory
    ./runCases.sh

3.Maintain Testcases

List of all the failed testcases is entered into TestResult/failedCases.
Analyze the failiures by looking at TEST files in the respective directory. Regold the testcases by running the following command.

./reGold.sh TestResult/failedCases
