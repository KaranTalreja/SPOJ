There is given a rectangular bitmap of size n*m. Each pixel of the bitmap is either white or black, but at least one is white. The pixel in i-th line and j-th column is called the pixel (i,j). The distance between two pixels p1=(i1,j1) and p2=(i2,j2) is defined as:

d(p1,p2)=|i1-i2|+|j1-j2|.
Task

Write a program which:

reads the description of the bitmap from the standard input,
for each pixel, computes the distance to the nearest white pixel,
writes the results to the standard output.

Instructions:
1.To build run command
    make
2.To run testcases run command in current directory
    ./runCases.sh

3.Maintain Testcases

List of all the failed testcases is entered into TestResult/failedCases.
Analyze the failiures by looking at TEST files in the respective directory. Regold the testcases by running the following command.

./reGold.sh TestResult/failedCases
