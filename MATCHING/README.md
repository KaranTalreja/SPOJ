FJ has N (1 ≤ N ≤ 50,000) cows and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 50,000) bulls. Given a list of P (1 ≤ P ≤ 150,000) potential matches between a cow and a bull, compute the greatest number of pairs that can be matched. Of course, a cow can be matched to at most one bull, and vice versa.


Instructions:
1.To build run command
    make
2.To run testcases run command in current directory
    ./runCases.sh

3.Maintain Testcases

List of all the failed testcases is entered into TestResult/failedCases.
Analyze the failiures by looking at TEST files in the respective directory. Regold the testcases by running the following command.

./reGold.sh TestResult/failedCases
